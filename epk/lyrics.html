HIBERNATED EMBRACE 
</p>
<p id="text">
A game of pinball to teach humility <br>
as I hit the bumper car, I laugh in disbelief <br>
back at the Chichen Itza playing unreal tournaments <br>
What if all these creatures are me in different shapes?  <br>
Startled by my exhalation I accept  <br>
as I curl up for the hibernated embrace  <br>
 <br>
Mosaics in playful tessellation  <br>
The figment of our incantations  <br>
 <br>
Accept this offering, dear features of my brain <br>
The empty space for us to confer in  <br>
 <br>
Mosaics in playful tessellation <br>
 The figment of our incantations <br>
 <br>

  ETERNAL AFTERNOON
</p>
<p id="text">
 Caught myself daydreaming I could float <br>
as a sun kissed particle of dust <br>
in the slow eternal afternoon <br>
suspended in a Brownian motion blur <br>
<br>
Just keep on swirling slowly ‘cross the fishbone floor<br>
and let's stir up mesocyclones<br>
we got our competition tucked up in our sleeves<br>
as long the sun keeps shining on<br>
But in due time we all shall be released<br>
<br>
Now leave it up to me to set these plans into commotion<br>
courtesy of those who can wait<br>
we are but particularities, flavors of primordial soup<br>
<br>
But in due time, as our stories intertwine<br>
We shall conjure all those secrets divine<br>
<br>
Where we found our way <br>
Where we found our way<br>
Where we found our way<br>
Where we found our way<br>

  IDIOSYNCRASIES
</p>
<p id="text">
 Underneath the surface of your fingertips<br>
the carbonated skin leaves you bare<br>
Trying to avoid the hypotheticals<br>
‘cause you let them all run their course<br>
<br>
Hear me now, let me speak before the crowd<br>
got no things to say just need the limelight<br>
Night or day makes no difference no more<br>
it's just a pale gray, restless eve<br>
<br>
Powerless as you scream into the void<br>
as you mark the motions one last time<br>
Violins hidden deep inside the walls<br>
come to serenade your demise<br>
<br>
Quietly, not quite expecting to be heard<br>
you announce yourself to the world<br>
Woke up sore... I must have chewed on some glass<br>
as I swallowed this city whole<br>
<br>
Powerless as you scream into the void<br>
you run through the motions one last time<br>
Violins hidden deep inside the walls<br>
come to serenade your demise<br>
<br>

INSIDE MY HEAD 
</p>
<p id='text'>
You’re watering it down with comedy<br>
Built yourself a wall from within<br>
You try to understand but you’re faltering<br>
Don’t pry inside my head Don’t pry inside my head Don’t pry inside my head<br>
<br>
You can’t back out now, you’re in too deep<br>
Locked yourself in a box and swallowed the key<br>
You try to understand but you’re faltering<br>
<br>
You keep on weeding us out, but we don’t even feel it<br>
You keep on weeding us out, entirely<br>
Don’t pry inside my head<br>
Don’t pry inside my head<br>
Don’t pry inside my head<br>
<br>
The tides are all turning on you<br>
you don’t notice how it feels<br>
like you don’t know, you don’t know<br>
<br>
Leave me be<br>
Leave me be<br>
Leave me be<br>
<br>

SERENDIPITY
</p>
<p id='text'>
I’m chasing trees, trying to get lost<br>
and I’m starting to believe I<br>
I’m eating leaves, I’m running wild<br>
Shed my skin against the peat moss<br>
<br>
Don’t fall asleep, this time around<br>
Though it seems to be relieving<br>
Forget to breathe, your eyes are clouds<br>
and your mouth is out of season<br>
<br>
A breath explodes in mine<br>
a mist surrounding serendipity<br>
<br>
Forget to breathe this time around<br>
you’re seeing the new world<br>
climb up to me, you’re barking at<br>
The ceiling mirror sees you<br>
<br>
A breath explodes in mine<br>
a mist surrounding serendipity<br>
<br>

WE CONTROL  
</p>
<p id='text'>
We control everything you know<br>
we’re your…<br>
<br>
We observe every thought and urge<br>
we’re your…<br>
<br>
Your thoughts and desires<br>
are ours to provide<br>
<br>
We control everything you know<br>
we’re your…<br>
<br>
Your thoughts and desires<br>
belong to the depths of our silicone towers<br>
to fuel our predictive powers<br>
to build a world where all is ours<br>
where we know everything about you<br>
we know everything about you<br>
we know everything about you<br>
<br>

FINE PRINT 
</p>
<p id='text'>
Routine procedure<br>
These are most favorable terms<br>
We shall deliver<br>
All that you dream of shall be yours<br>
<br>
There’s no mistaking<br>
You are the one we’re looking for<br>
This sworn allegiance Shall bring great fortune down the line<br>
<br>
Pearl white, silver and gold<br>
Yes, we all read your file<br>
Well you needn’t be so quiet<br>
<br>
You shall appease us<br>
as your contractually obliged<br>
There is this craving  just a pound of flesh can satisfy<br>
<br>
In time<br>
World wide infamy<br>
Yes, we all read your file<br>
Well you needn’t be so quiet<br>
<br>
Words don’t mean a thing to me<br>
I need your full name in blood at the bottom page<br>
I got my whole arsenal of lawyers here<br>
all working so tirelessly to secure this case<br>
I got my whole system wide held disbelief <br>
at your own ability to assess critique <br>
it's not on your terms<br>
from here on out<br>
<br>
How could that be misunderstood?<br>
<br>
Don’t fuck it up this time<br>
Don’t fuck it up this time<br>

  VOLCANOLOGY 
</p>
<p id="text">
The divine and the earth<br>
Reunite before your nose<br>
<br>
Geese won’t shut up<br>
Bugs crawling out<br>
Goats go berserk<br>
Snakes waking up<br>
And the world begins to tremble<br>
as it sheds another hide<br>
<br>
Come into the inferno<br>
Come into the inferno<br>
<br>
It forms a running stream as<br>
innards gush out<br>
a waterfall of molten rocks<br>
eating all in its path<br>
<br>
creatures ossify<br>
live a second life<br>
embalmed by surprise<br>
lest they burn alive<br>
<br>
And the world returns to slumber<br>
its coagulated eye<br>
leaving those who didn’t crumble<br>
new fertile ground to try<br>
<br>
Come into the inferno<br>
Come into the inferno<br>
Come into the inferno<br>
Come into the inferno<br>
<br>

PLAY DOUGH
</p>
<p id="text">
Bend us to your goals<br>
We’re made to serve your word<br>
Craving your control<br>
We’re play dough for your soul<br>
<br>
Terraform your cosmic maiden<br>
her surface is your plate<br>
Galvanize and clear thy neighbor<br>
indulge in atmosphere<br>
<br>
Guess what makes us all stay up all night<br>
<br>
Trapped inside her weightless chamber<br>
your excavated grave<br>
bio-luminescent creatures illuminate the way<br>
<br>
Guess what makes us all stay up all night<br>
<br>
Rumination, rumination<br>
Pushing your circadian rhythm out of line<br>
Rumination, rumination<br>
As you trace the silhouette across your cornea<br>
<br>
She keeps us in a mason jar with<br>
some holes poked to breathe<br>
Builds herself a pedestal and asks us not to kneel<br>
Tucked in underneath your tongue<br>
she bleeds into your speech<br>
At the pouring of the waterfall still gushing in your ear<br>
<br>
Feels like I’m going nocturnal again<br>
Feels like I’m going nocturnal again<br>
Feels like I’m going nocturnal again<br>
Feels like I’m going nocturnal again<br>
<br>
